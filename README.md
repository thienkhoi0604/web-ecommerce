This is project in university

(This is just temporary)\

## 1. Rule git
**- Branch dev is main branch for developer**\
**- Create new branch before code a feature**\
**- Avoid commit code with general commit messages**\
Ex.\
-> avoid: fix bug, add view, change api,......\
-> should: fix responsive in dashboard page, handle api to solve request get user,......\
**- When finish code create pull request to review code before merging into dev branch**\
\
Example flow git handler:\
-----------GIT FLOW-------------\
git checkout dev\
git pull\
git checkout -b responsive-dashboard\
\
coding...\
\
git commit -m "handle responsive in desktop screens"\
git commit -m "fix conflict and do something more..."\
git push\
--------------------------------------\
\
## 2. Rule flow work\
**- Report weekly (often on Saturday)\
**- Commit code and push remote every day (just for case: maybe your laptop have problems)\
**- Main contact: FACEBOOK. If there are any questions, you should send here and tag (should pin).\
