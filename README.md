This is project in university

(This is just temporary)

## 1. Rule git
**- Branch dev is main branch for developer**
**- Create new branch before code a feature**
**- Avoid commit code with general commit messages**
Ex.
-> avoid: fix bug, add view, change api,......
-> should: fix responsive in dashboard page, handle api to solve request get user,......
**- When finish code create pull request to review code before merging into dev branch**

Example flow git handler:
-----------GIT FLOW-------------
- git checkout dev
- git pull
- git checkout -b responsive-dashboard

- coding...

- git commit -m "handle responsive in desktop screens"
- git commit -m "fix conflict and do something more..."
- git push
--------------------------------------

## 2. Rule flow work
**- Report weekly (often on Saturday)
**- Commit code and push remote every day (just for case: maybe your laptop have problems)
**- Main contact: FACEBOOK. If there are any questions, you should send here and tag (should pin).
